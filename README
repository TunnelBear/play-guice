## Changelog

### 1.4

 * upgrade to guice 4.0

### 1.3

 * support both javax.inject.Inject and com.google.inject.Inject annotations
 * first search for custom injectors, and only then - for Modules.  (the previous code depended on order of classes: which of them meets first in classpath)

### 1.2

 * copy of play-guice 1.2 plugin
 (taken from https://www.playframework.com/modules/guice)
 Initial github project seems to be dead: http://github.com/pk11/play-guice-module
